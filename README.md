# QML

This repository contains my explorations into the vast world of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Within each directory is a small encapsulation of an implementation of an idea or concept within QML that I learned about. Each will contain some code and a description in the form of an `.md` file. 

## Data Encoder

The data encoder explores ways of encoding classical data, like an $N$-dimensional sample $x$, into a quantum circuit. There are many ways to do this, but the ones featured here are Angle Encoding via rotation gates and Amplitude Encoding via multi-controlled $R_Y$ gates.
