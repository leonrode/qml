# data-encoder

This project explores methods of encoding classical data into a quantum circuit, otherwise known as embedding. The methods explored here are:

1. Angle encoding
2. Amplitude encoding
3. Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time (IQP) embedding

These are derived from the paper titled [Benchmarking data encoding methods in
Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14295).

The code for this script is contained in `main.ipynb`, and uses Pennylane as its implementation.
